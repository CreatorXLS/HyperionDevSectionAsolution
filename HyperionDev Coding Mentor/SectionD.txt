		PLAN OF ACTION TO ASSIST LAGGING STUDENTS

1. Schedule one-on-one meetings with the 5 lagging students to discuss their progress and the tasks they are behind on.
2. Develop individualized plans with the lagging students that outline strategies to get them back on track.
3. Work with the 10 at-risk students to ensure they complete their upcoming tasks in a timely manner.
4. Provide additional guidance, coaching, and/or resources (e.g. videos, tutorials, webinars) to the 10 at-risk students to help them stay on track.
5. Provide encouragement and incentives (e.g. rewards, recognition) to the 5 students that are ahead, to ensure they remain motivated and engaged.
6. Monitor the progress of all 20 students and provide feedback to them on a regular basis.
7. Keep the lines of communication open and available for all students to ensure they feel comfortable coming to you with questions or concerns.
