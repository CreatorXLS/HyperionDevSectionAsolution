SECTION A CODE
#Line 1: This is the declaration of the class which contains the solution.
#Line 2: This defines the method which will be used to group the anagrams.
#Line 3: This initializes an empty dictionary which will be used to store the sorted versions of the strings as keys and the anagrams as values.
#Line 4: This loop iterates through the strings in the list.
#Line 5: This creates a new string which is the sorted version of the current string in the loop.
#Line 6: This checks if the sorted version of the string is already in the dictionary as a key.
#Line 7: If it is, this adds the current string in the loop to the list of values associated with that key.
#Line 8: If the key isn't in the dictionary, this adds the sorted version of the string as a key, and the current string in the loop as the first value associated with it.
#Line 9: This returns a list of all the values in the dictionary.
