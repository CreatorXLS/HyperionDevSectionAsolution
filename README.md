SECTION A CODE
#Line 1: This is the declaration of the class which contains the solution.
#Line 2: This defines the method which will be used to group the anagrams.
#Line 3: This initializes an empty dictionary which will be used to store the sorted versions of the strings as keys and the anagrams as values.
#Line 4: This loop iterates through the strings in the list.
#Line 5: This creates a new string which is the sorted version of the current string in the loop.
#Line 6: This checks if the sorted version of the string is already in the dictionary as a key.
#Line 7: If it is, this adds the current string in the loop to the list of values associated with that key.
#Line 8: If the key isn't in the dictionary, this adds the sorted version of the string as a key, and the current string in the loop as the first value associated with it.
#Line 9: This returns a list of all the values in the dictionary.
#Line 10: This creates an object of the Solution class.
#Line 11: This prints the result of the groupAnagrams() method, which is a list of the anagrams.

SECTION C JAVASCRIPT NUMERIC VALUE TO STRING
// This is a function called sayNumber that takes in an argument of num.
// 1. A variable called numString is declared and is set to the argument num converted to a string. 
// 2. A variable called finalString is declared and is set to an empty string. 
// 3. An object called numbers is initialized with key-value pairs of numbers and their word equivalents.
// 4. Another object called tens is initialized with key-value pairs of numbers and their word equivalents (in the tens place).
// 5. An if statement is used to check if num is 0 - if it is, the string "Zero" is returned.
// 6. Another if statement is used to check if num is less than 20 - if it is, the string of the word version of the number is returned.
// 7. A variable called trillions is declared and is set to the argument num divided by trillion and rounded down to the nearest whole number.
// 8. An if statement is used to check if trillions is greater than 0 - if it is, the finalString is updated to add the word version of the trillions number and a comma. The argument num is then updated to subtract the trillions amount. 
// 9. Steps 7-8 are repeated for billions, millions, and thousands. 
// 10. An if statement is used to check if num is greater than 0 - if it is, the finalString is updated to add the word version of the number.
// 11. The finalString is returned with the last two characters removed (the comma and space) and a period added. 
// 12. A function called processNum is declared that takes in the argument num. 
// 13. A variable called numString is declared and is set to the argument num converted to a string. 
// 14. Variables called trillion, hundreds, tensDigit, and onesDigit are declared and set to the appropriate part of the numString.
// 15. An empty string is initialized for the string variable. 
// 16. An if statement is used to check if trillion is greater than 0 - if it is, the string is updated to add the word version of the trillions number and "and" if hundreds, tensDigit, or onesDigit is greater than 0.
// 17. An if statement is used to check if hundreds is greater than 0 - if it is, the string is updated to add the word version of the hundreds number and "and" if tensDigit or onesDigit is greater than 0.
// 18. An if statement is used to check if tensDigit is greater than 1 - if it is, the string is updated to add the word version of the tensDigit number and the word version of the onesDigit number with a hyphen if onesDigit is greater than 0.
// 19. An else if statement is used to check if tensDigit is equal to 1 - if it is, the string is updated to add the word version of the tensDigit + onesDigit number.
// 20. An else if statement is used to check if onesDigit is greater than 0 - if it is, the string is updated to add the word version of the onesDigit number.
// 21. The string is returned.


Section D helping lagging students
		PLAN OF ACTION TO ASSIST LAGGING STUDENTS

1. Schedule one-on-one meetings with the 5 lagging students to discuss their progress and the tasks they are behind on.
2. Develop individualized plans with the lagging students that outline strategies to get them back on track.
3. Work with the 10 at-risk students to ensure they complete their upcoming tasks in a timely manner.
4. Provide additional guidance, coaching, and/or resources (e.g. videos, tutorials, webinars) to the 10 at-risk students to help them stay on track.
5. Provide encouragement and incentives (e.g. rewards, recognition) to the 5 students that are ahead, to ensure they remain motivated and engaged.
6. Monitor the progress of all 20 students and provide feedback to them on a regular basis.
7. Keep the lines of communication open and available for all students to ensure they feel comfortable coming to you with questions or concerns.
